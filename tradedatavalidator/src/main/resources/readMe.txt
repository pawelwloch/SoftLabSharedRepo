This project was developed as a sample to show in a easy way some validation rules can be dynamically applied to incoming data and how in easy way one can add some new rules.
Project uses a open source library called Language Independent Validation Rules (v2.0) project that is available at the url: http://livr-spec.org/.

Validation rules are extensible. They are declared in the 'LIVR validation rules.txt' file.

Types scanning can be declared by using 'or' rule or 'list_of_different_object' rule.
Due to lack of time I haven't tested them by e.g. specifying to possible objects (one for Spot/Forward options and one the other for VanillaOption).

If you would like to know more I would be happy to be able to discuss it with You personal.

Sincerely,
